PhoneNumber --> valid number function (0 _ 8)
like :
if (is_valid_number(data[3]))
	break;
std::cout << "Please input a valid number" << std::endl;

Initializer List
	count()
	{ count = 0; }
	However, this is not the preferred approach (although it does work). Hereâ€™s how you should
	initialize a data member:
	count() : count(0)
	{ }
/--------------------------/
if (!std::getline(std::cin, Fname))
	This condition uses the logical NOT
 	(!) operator to check the opposite 
 	of the return value of std::getline.
	It checks if std::getline was unsuccessful,
	meaning it failed to read a line of input or
	encountered an error.
if (std::getline(std::cin, Fname))
	This condition checks whether 
	std::getline was successful in reading 
	a line of input. If std::getline successfully
	reads a line from std::cin, it returns true,
	indicating that input was received.
